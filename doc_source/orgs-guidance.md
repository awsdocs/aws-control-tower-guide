# AWS Organizations Guidance<a name="orgs-guidance"></a>
+ You can find guidance about best practices to protect the security of your AWS Control Tower management account and member accounts in the AWS Organizations documentation\.
  + [Best practices for the management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_best-practices_mgmt-acct.html)
  + [Best practices for member accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/best-practices_member-acct.html)
+ Do not use AWS Organizations to update service control policies \(SCPs\) attached to an OU that is registered with AWS Control Tower\. Doing so could result in the guardrails entering an unknown state, which will require you to repair your landing zone or re\-register your OU in AWS Control Tower\. Instead, you can create new SCPs and attach those to the OUs rather than editing the SCPs that AWS Control Tower has created\.
+ Moving individual, already enrolled, accounts into AWS Control Tower, from outside of a registered OU, causes drift that must be repaired\. See [Types of Governance Drift](governance-drift.md)\.
+ If you use AWS Organizations to create, invite, or move accounts within an organization registered with AWS Control Tower, those accounts are not enrolled by AWS Control Tower and those changes are not recorded\. If you need access to these accounts through SSO, see [Member Account Access](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/organizations-member-account-access/)\.
+ If you use AWS Organizations to move an OU into an organization created by AWS Control Tower, the external OU is not registered by AWS Control Tower\.
+ AWS Control Tower handles permission filtering differently than AWS Organizations does\. If your accounts are provisioned with AWS Control Tower account factory, end users can see the names and parents of all OUs in the AWS Control Tower console, even if they don't have permission to retrieve those names and parents from AWS Organizations directly\.
+ AWS Control Tower does not support mixed permissions on organizations, such as permission to view an OU's parent but not to view OU names\. For this reason, AWS Control Tower administrators are expected to have full permissions\.
