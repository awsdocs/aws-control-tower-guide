# AWS Organizations Guidance<a name="orgs-guidance"></a>
+ You can find guidance about best practices to protect the security of your AWS Control Tower management account and member accounts in the AWS Organizations documentation\.
  + [Best practices for the management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_best-practices_mgmt-acct.html)
  + [Best practices for member accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/best-practices_member-acct.html)
+ Do not use AWS Organizations to update service control policies \(SCPs\) attached to an OU that is registered with AWS Control Tower\. Doing so could result in the controls entering an unknown state, which will require you to repair your landing zone or re\-register your OU in AWS Control Tower\. Instead, you can create new SCPs and attach those to the OUs rather than editing the SCPs that AWS Control Tower has created\.
+ Moving individual, already enrolled, accounts into AWS Control Tower, from outside of a registered OU, causes drift that must be repaired\. See [Types of Governance Drift](governance-drift.md)\.
+ If you use AWS Organizations to create, invite, or move accounts within an organization registered with AWS Control Tower, those accounts are not enrolled by AWS Control Tower and those changes are not recorded\. If you need access to these accounts through SSO, see [Member Account Access](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/organizations-member-account-access/)\.
+ If you use AWS Organizations to move an OU into an organization created by AWS Control Tower, the external OU is not registered by AWS Control Tower\.
+ AWS Control Tower handles permission filtering differently than AWS Organizations does\. If your accounts are provisioned with AWS Control Tower account factory, end users can see the names and parents of all OUs in the AWS Control Tower console, even if they don't have permission to retrieve those names and parents from AWS Organizations directly\.
+ AWS Control Tower does not support mixed permissions on organizations, such as permission to view an OU's parent but not to view OU names\. For this reason, AWS Control Tower administrators are expected to have full permissions\.
+ The AWS Organizations **FullAWSAccess** SCP must be applied and should not be merged with other SCPs\. Change to this SCP is not reported as drift; however, some changes may affect AWS Control Tower functionality in unpredictable ways, if access to certain resources is denied\. For example, if the SCP is detached, or modified, an account may lose access to an AWS Config recorder or create a gap in CloudTrail logging\.
+ Do not use the AWS Organizations `DisableAWSServiceAccess` API to turn off AWS Control Tower service access to the organization where youâ€™ve set up your landing zone\. If you do so, certain AWS Control Tower drift detection features may not function properly without messaging support from AWS Organizations\. These drift detection features help guarantee that AWS Control Tower can report the compliance status of of organizational units, accounts, and controls in your organization accurately\. For more information, see [`API_DisableAWSServiceAccess` in the AWS Organizations API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DisableAWSServiceAccess.html)\.
