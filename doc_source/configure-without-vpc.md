# Walkthrough: Configuring AWS Control Tower Without a VPC<a name="configure-without-vpc"></a>

This topic walks through how to configure your AWS Control Tower accounts without a VPC\.

**If your workload does not require a VPC**
+ You can delete the AWS Control Tower master account virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\. This VPC was created when you set up your landing zone\.
+ You can change your Account Factory settings so that new AWS Control Tower accounts are created without an associated VPC\.

## Delete the AWS Control Tower Master Account VPC<a name="delete-master-vpc"></a>

Outside of AWS Control Tower, every AWS customer has a default VPC, which you can view on the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\. Youâ€™ll recognize the default VPC, because its name always includes the word *\(default\)* at the end of the name\.

When you set up a AWS Control Tower landing zone, AWS Control Tower deletes your AWS default VPC and creates a new AWS Control Tower default VPC\. The new VPC is associated with your AWS Control Tower master account\. This topic refers to that new VPC as the *Control Tower master account VPC*\.

When you view your AWS Control Tower master account VPC in the Amazon VPC console, you will *not* see the word *\(default\)* at the end of the name\. If you have more than one VPC, you must use the assigned CIDR range to identify the correct AWS Control Tower master account VPC\.

You can delete the AWS Control Tower master account VPC, but if you later need a VPC in AWS Control Tower, you must create it yourself\.

**To delete the AWS Control Tower master account VPC**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. Search for **VPC** or select **VPC** from the AWS Service Catalog options\. You then see the **VPC Dashboard**\.

1. From the menu on the left, choose **Your VPCs**\. You then see a list of all your VPCs\.

1. Identify the AWS Control Tower master account VPC by its CIDR range\.

1. To delete the VPC, choose **Actions** and then choose **Delete VPC**\.

## Create an Account in AWS Control Tower Without a VPC<a name="create-without-vpc"></a>

If your end user workloads do not require VPCs, you can use this method to set up user accounts that don't have VPCs created for them automatically\.

From the AWS Control Tower dashboard, you can view and edit your network configurations settings\. After you change the settings so that AWS Control Tower accounts are created without an associated VPC, all new accounts are created without a VPC until you change the settings again\.

**To view your current **Network Configuration** on the Account Factory page**

1. Open a web browser, and navigate to the AWS Control Tower console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/controltower](https://console.aws.amazon.com/controltower)\.

1. Choose **Account Factory** from the menu on the left\.

1. You then see the Account Factory page with the **Network Configuration** section\.

1. Note the current settings if you intend to restore them later\.

1. To edit your **Network Configuration** settings, choose the **Edit** button\.

1.  You then see the **Edit account factory network configuration** page, with a section titled **VPC Configuration options for new accounts**

1. Within that section, follow these steps:

1. Turn off the **Internet\-accessible subnet** toggle switch\.

1. Set the **Maximum number of private subnets** value to 0\.

1. Change the **Address range \(CIDR\) restriction for account VPCs** value to `10.0.0.0/16`

1. Clear every checkbox in the **Regions for VPC creation** column\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

**Notes on Possible Errors**
+ If you leave the default CIDR in place when setting up to launch new accounts without a VPC, your request fails with an error that *the CIDR is not valid*\.
+ Your existing master account may have dependencies or resources in the AWS Control Tower master account VPC, which can cause a *deletion failure* error\.
