 If you previously deployed *Customizations for AWS Control Tower* \(CfCT\), follow the procedure to update the AWS CloudFormation stack for the latest version of the CfCT framework\. 

**Important**  
 Before you can complete the following procedure, you must upload the [latest template from GitHub](  https://github.com/aws-solutions/aws-control-tower-customizations/blob/main/customizations-for-aws-control-tower.template) to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\. For instructions on how to get started with Amazon S3, see [Getting started with Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GetStartedWithS3.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*\. 

1.  Sign in to the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)\. 

1.  Select your existing **Customizations for AWS Control Tower** \(CfCT\) CloudFormation stack, and then select **Update**\.
