When you follow the **Create account** workflow to add your member accounts, you can optionally specify a previously\-defined *blueprint* to use for provisioning customized member accounts from the AWS Control Tower console\. You can customize accounts later if you do not have a blueprint available\. See [Customize accounts with Account Factory Customization \(AFC\)](af-customization-page.md)\.
