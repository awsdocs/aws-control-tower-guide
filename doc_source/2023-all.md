## Additional proactive controls available<a name="new-proactive-controls"></a>

**May 19, 2023**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\.\)

AWS Control Tower is adding 28 new proactive controls to assist you in governing your multi\-account environment and meeting specific control objectives, such as data encryption at rest, or limiting network access\. Proactive controls are implemented with AWS CloudFormation hooks that check your resources before they are provisioned\. The new controls can help govern AWS services such as Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon SageMaker, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon Relational Database Service \(RDS\)\.

Proactive controls are supported in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Control Tower is available\.

## Updated Amazon EC2 proactive controls<a name="updated-ec2-controls"></a>

**May 2, 2023**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\.\)

AWS Control Tower has updated two proactive controls: CT\.EC2\.PR\.3 and CT\.EC2\.PR\.4\.

For the updated CT\.EC2\.PR\.3 control, any AWS CloudFormation deployment that references a prefix list for a security group resource is blocked from deployment, unless it is for port 80 or 443\.

For the updated CT\.EC2\.PR\.4 control, any AWS CloudFormation deployment that references a prefix list for a security group resource is blocked if the port is 3389, 20, 23, 110, 143, 3306, 8080, 1433, 9200, 9300, 25, 445, 135, 21, 1434, 4333, 5432, 5500, 5601, 22, 3000, 5000, 8088, 8888\.

## Seven additional AWS Regions available<a name="seven-regions"></a>

**April 19, 2023**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\.\)

AWS Control Tower is now available in seven additional AWS Regions: Northern California \(San Francisco\), Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Osaka\), Europe \(Milan\), Middle East \(Bahrain\), and Africa \(Cape Town\)\. These additional Regions for AWS Control Tower, called *opt\-in Regions*, are not active by default, except the US West \(N\. California\) Region, which is active by default\.

Some controls in AWS Control Tower do not operate in some of these additional AWS Regions where AWS Control Tower is available, because those Regions do not support the required underlying functionality\. For details, see [Control limitations](limits.md#control-limitations)\.

Among these new Regions, CfCT is not available in Asia Pacific \(Jakarta and Osaka\)\. Availability in other AWS Regions is unchanged\.

For more information about how AWS Control Tower manages the limitations of Regions and controls, see [Considerations for activating AWS opt\-in Regions](opt-in-region-considerations.md)\.

The VPCe endpoints required by AFT are not available in the Middle East \(Bahrain\) Region\. Customers deploying AFT in this Region are required to deploy with parameter `aft_vpc_endpoints=false`\. For more information, see the parameter in [ the README file](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory#input_aft_vpc_endpoints)\. 

AWS Control Tower VPCs have two Availability Zones in the US West \(N\. California\) Region, `us-west-1`, due to a limitation in Amazon EC2\. In the US West \(N\. California\), six subnets are divided across two Availability Zones\. For more information, see [Overview of AWS Control Tower and VPCs](vpc-concepts.md)\.

AWS Control Tower added new permissions to `AWSControlTowerServiceRolePolicy` that allow AWS Control Tower to make calls to the `EnableRegion`, `ListRegions`, and `GetRegionOptStatus` APIs implemented by the AWS Account Management service, to make these additional AWS Regions available for your shared accounts in the landing zone \(Management account, Log archive account, Audit account\) and your OU member accounts\. For more information, see [Managed policies for AWS Control Tower](access-control-managing-permissions.md#managed-policies-table)\.

## Account Factory for Terraform \(AFT\) account customization request tracing<a name="account-customization-request-tracing-ga"></a>

AFT supports account customization request tracing\. Every time you submit an account customization request, AFT generates a unique tracing token that passes through an AFT customization AWS Step Functions state machine, which logs the token as part of its execution\. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs insights queries to search timestamp ranges and retrieve the request token\. As a result, you can see payloads that accompany the token, so you can trace your account customization request throughout the entire AFT workflow\. For more information about AFT, see [Overview of AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-overview.html)\. For information about CloudWatch Logs and Step Functions, see the following: 
+  [What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide* 
+  [What is AWS Step Functions?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the *AWS Step Functions Developer Guide* 

## AWS Control Tower landing zone version 3\.1<a name="lz-3-1"></a>

February 9, 2023

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone to version 3\.1\. For information, seeÂ [Update Your Landing Zone](update-controltower.md)\)

AWS Control Tower landing zone version 3\.1 includes the following updates:
+ With this release, AWS Control Tower deactivates unnecessary access logging for your *access logging bucket*, which is the Amazon S3 bucket where access logs are stored in the Log Archive account, while continuing to enable server access logging for S3 buckets\. This release also includes updates to the Region Deny control that allow additional actions for global services, such as AWS Support Plans and AWS Artifact\. 
+ Deactivation of server access logging for the AWS Control Tower access logging bucket causes Security Hub to create a finding for the Log Archive account's *access logging bucket*, due to an AWS Security Hub rule, [\[S3\.9\] S3 bucket server access logging should be enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#fsbp-s3-9)\. In alignment with Security Hub, we recommend that you suppress this particular finding, as stated in the Security Hub description of this rule\. For additional information, see [information about suppressed findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-workflow-status.html)\.
+ Access logging for the \(regular\) logging bucket in the Log Archive account is unchanged in version 3\.1\. In alignment with best practices, access events for that bucket are recorded as log entries in the *access logging bucket*\.  For more information about access logging, see [Logging requests using server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html) in the Amazon S3 documentation\.
+ We made an update of the Region Deny control\. This update allows actions by more global services\. For details of this SCP, see [Deny access to AWS based on the requested AWS Region](data-residency-controls.md#primary-region-deny-policy) and [Controls that enhance data residency protection](data-residency-controls.md)\.

## Proactive controls generally available<a name="proactive-control-ga"></a>

**January 24, 2023**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\.\)

Optional proactive controls, previously announced in preview status, are now generally available\. These controls are referred to as proactive because they check your resources â before the resources are deployed â to determine whether the new resources comply with the controls that are activated in your environment\. For more information, see [Comprehensive controls assist in AWS resource provisioning and management](2022-all.md#proactive-controls-notes)\.
