Since January 2023, AWS Control Tower has released the following updates:
+  [ Account Factory for Terraform \(AFT\) account customization request tracing ](#account-customization-request-tracing-ga) 
+  [AWS Control Tower landing zone version 3\.1](#lz-3-1) 
+  [Proactive controls generally available](#proactive-control-ga) 

## Account Factory for Terraform \(AFT\) account customization request tracing<a name="account-customization-request-tracing-ga"></a>

 AFT supports account customization request tracing\. Every time you submit an account customization request, AFT generates a unique tracing token that passes through an AFT customization AWS Step Functions state machine, which logs the token as part of its execution\. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs insights queries to search timestamp ranges and retrieve the request token\. As a result, you can see payloads that accompany the token, so you can trace your account customization request throughout the entire AFT workflow\. For more information about AFT, see [Overview of AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-overview.html)\. For information about CloudWatch Logs and Step Functions, see the following:

## AWS Control Tower landing zone version 3\.1<a name="lz-3-1"></a>

February 9, 2023

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone to version 3\.1\. For information, see [Update Your Landing Zone](update-controltower.md)\)

AWS Control Tower landing zone version 3\.1 includes the following updates:
+ With this release, AWS Control Tower deactivates unneccessary access logging for your *access logging bucket*, which is the Amazon S3 bucket where access logs are stored in the Log Archive account, while continuing to enable server access logging for S3 buckets\. This release also includes updates to the Region Deny control that allow additional actions for global services, such as AWS Support Plans and AWS Artifact\. 
+ Deactivation of server access logging for the AWS Control Tower access logging bucket causes Security Hub to create a finding for the Log Archive account's *access logging bucket*, due to an AWS Security Hub rule, [\[S3\.9\] S3 bucket server access logging should be enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#fsbp-s3-9)\. In alignment with Security Hub, we recommend that you suppress this particular finding, as stated in the Security Hub description of this rule\. For additional information, see [information about suppressed findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-workflow-status.html)\.
+ Access logging for the \(regular\) logging bucket in the Log Archive account is unchanged in version 3\.1\. In alignment with best practices, access events for that bucket are recorded as log entries in the *access logging bucket*\.  For more information about access logging, see [Logging requests using server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html) in the Amazon S3 documentation\.
+ We made an update of the Region Deny control\. This update allows actions by more global services\. For details of this SCP, see [Deny access to AWS based on the requested AWS Region](data-residency-controls.md#primary-region-deny-policy) and [Controls that enhance data residency protection](data-residency-controls.md)\.

## Proactive controls generally available<a name="proactive-control-ga"></a>

**January 24, 2023**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\.\)

Optional proactive controls, previously announced in preview status, are now generally available\. These controls are referred to as proactive because they check your resources – before the resources are deployed – to determine whether the new resources comply with the controls that are activated in your environment\. For more information, see [Comprehensive controls assist in AWS resource provisioning and management](2022-all.md#proactive-controls-notes)\.
