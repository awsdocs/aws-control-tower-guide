# Submit multiple account requests<a name="aft-multiple-account-requests"></a>

 AFT processes account requests one at a time, but you can submit multiple account requests to the AFT pipeline\. When you submit multiple account requests to the AFT pipeline, AFT queues and processes the account requests in a first\-in, first\-out order\. 

**Note**  
 You can create an account request Terraform file for each account that you want AFT to provision or cascade multiple account requests in a single account request Terraform file\.
