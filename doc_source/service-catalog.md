# Provision Accounts Through Service Catalog<a name="service-catalog"></a>

AWS Service Catalog enables IT administrators to create, manage, and distribute portfolios of approved products to end users, who then have access to the products they need in a personalized portal\. Typical products include servers, databases, websites, or applications that are deployed using AWS resources\.


You can control the users that have access to specific products, which allows you to enforce compliance with organizational business standards, manage product lifecycles, and help users find and launch products with confidence\. For more information, see *[Service Catalog Administrator Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/)*\.

In AWS Control Tower, your central cloud administrators and your end users can provision accounts in your landing zone using Account Factory, a product in Service Catalog\. For more information, see [Provision and manage accounts with Account Factory](account-factory.md)\.

AWS Control Tower also can make use of the AWS Service Catalog APIs to further automate account provisioning and updating\. For details, see [the AWS Service Catalog Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/dg/what-is-service-catalog.html)\.
