# Common causes of failure during registration or re\-registration<a name="common-eg-failures"></a>

If registration \(or re\-registration\) of an OU or any of its member accounts fails, you can download a file containing a detailed report that shows which pre\-checks did not pass\. You can complete the download by choosing the **Download** button, which appears at the upper right of the registration area\.

 This section lists the types of errors you may receive if pre\-checks fail, and how to correct the errors\.

In general, when you register or re\-register an OU, all accounts within that OU are enrolled in AWS Control Tower\. However, it is possible that some accounts may fail to enroll, even if the OU as a whole is registered successfully\. In these cases, you must resolve the pre\-check failure related to the account and then try re\-enrolling that account or OU\.

**Landing Zone error**
+ **Landing zone not ready**

  Repair your current landing zone, or update it to the latest version\.

**OU errors**
+ **Exceeds maximum number of SCPs**

  You may be over the limit for service control policies \(SCPs\) per OU, or you may have reached another quota\. A limit of 5 SCPs per OU applies to all OUs in your AWS Control Tower landing zone\. If you have more SCPs than the quota allows, you must delete or combine the SCPs\.
+ **Conflicting SCPs**

  Existing SCPs may be applied to the OU or account, which prevent AWS Control Tower from enrolling the account\. Check the applied SCPs for any policy that may prevent AWS Control Tower from working\. Be sure to check the SCPs that are inherited from OUs higher in the hierarchy\.
+ **Exceeds stack set quota**

  The stack set quota may have been exceeded\.  If you have more instances than the quota allows, you must delete some stack instances\. For more information, see [AWS CloudFormation quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.
+ **Exceeds account limit**

  AWS Control Tower limits each OU to 298 accounts during registration\.

**Account errors**
+ **Pre\-checks prevented on accounts**

  An existing SCP on the OU prevents AWS Control Tower from conducting pre\-checks on your OU member accounts\. To resolve this pre\-check failure, update or remove the SCP from the OU\.
+ **Email address error**

  The email address you specified for the account does not conform to the naming standards\. Here is the regular expression \(regex\) that specifies which characters are allowed: `[A-Z0-9a-z._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+[.]+[A-Za-z]+`
+ **Config recorder or delivery channel enabled**

  The account may have an existing AWS Config configuration recorder or delivery channel\. These must be deleted or modified through the AWS CLI in all AWS Regions where the AWS Control Tower management account has governed resources, before you can enroll an account\.
+ **STS disabled**

  AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\) may be disabled in the account\. AWS STS endpoints must be activated in the accounts for all Regions supported by AWS Control Tower\.
+ **IAM Identity Center conflict**

  The AWS Control Tower home Region is not the same as the AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) \(IAM Identity Center\) Region\. If IAM Identity Center is already set up, the AWS Control Tower home region must be the same as the IAM Identity Center Region\.
+ **Conflicting SNS topic**

  The account has an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic name that AWS Control Tower needs to use\. AWS Control Tower creates resources \(such as SNS topics\) with specific names\. If these names are already taken, AWS Control Tower setup fails\. This situation could occur if you are reusing an account previously enrolled in AWS Control Tower\.
+ **Suspended account detected**

  This account has been suspended\. It cannot be enrolled into AWS Control Tower\. Remove the account from this OU, and try again\.
+ **IAM user not in portfolio**

  Add the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user to the AWS Service Catalog portfolio before registering your OU\. This error pertains to the management account only\.
+ **Account does not meet prerequisites**

  The account doesnâ€™t meet prerequisites for account enrollment\. For example, the account may be missing roles and permissions required to enroll it in AWS Control Tower\. Instructions for adding a role are available in [Manually add the required IAM role to an existing AWS account and enroll it](enroll-manually.md)\.

As a reminder, AWS CloudTrail is auto\-enabled on all of your AWS accounts when you enroll them in AWS Control Tower\. If CloudTrail is enabled on an account previous to enrollment, you could experience double\-billing unless you deactivate CloudTrail before you begin the enrollment process\.
