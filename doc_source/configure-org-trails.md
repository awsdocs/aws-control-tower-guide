# Optionally configure AWS CloudTrail trails<a name="configure-org-trails"></a>

As a best practice, we recommend that you set up logging\. If you wish to allow AWS Control Tower to set up an organization\-level CloudTrail trail and manage it for you, choose **Opt in**\. If you wish to manage logging with your own CloudTrail trails or a third\-party logging tool, choose **Opt out**\. Confirm your selection when requested to do so in the console\. You can change your selection, and opt into, or opt out of, organization\-level trails when you update your landing zone\.

You can set up and manage your own CloudTrail trails at any time, including organization\-level and account\-level trails\. If you set up duplicate CloudTrail trails, you may incur duplicate costs when CloudTrail events are logged\.
