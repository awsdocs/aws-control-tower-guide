# Account Factory Guidance<a name="af-guidance"></a>
+ When you use Account Factory to provision new accounts in AWS Control Tower, do not define `TagOptions`, enable notifications, or create a provisioned product plan\. Doing so can result in a failure to provision a new account\.
+ If you are authenticated as an IAM user when you provision accounts in Account Factory or when you use the **Enroll account** feature, be sure the IAM user is [added to the AWS Service Catalog portfolio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/catalogs_portfolios_users.html) so that it has the correct permissions\. Otherwise, you may receive an error message from AWS Service Catalog that is difficult to understand\. Common causes for this type of error are given in the Troubleshooting guide\. In particular, refer to the section entitled [No Launch Paths Found Error](troubleshooting.md#no-launch-paths-found)\.
+ Remember that only one account can be provisioned at a time\.
