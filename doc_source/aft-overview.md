# Overview of AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform<a name="aft-overview"></a>

 Account Factory for Terraform \(AFT\) sets up a Terraform pipeline to help you provision and customize accounts in AWS Control Tower\. AFT provides you with the advantage of Terraform\-based account provisioning while allowing you to govern your accounts with AWS Control Tower\. 

 With AFT you create an *account request Terraform file* to get the input that triggers the AFT workflow for account provisioning\. After the account provisioning stage is complete, AFT automatically runs a series of steps before the account customizations stage begins\. For more information, see [AFT account provisioning pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-provisioning-framework.html)\. 

 AFT supports Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise, and Terraform Open Source\. With AFT you can initiate account creation using an input file and a simple `git push` command and customize new or existing accounts\. Account creation includes all of the AWS Control Tower governance benefits and account customizations that help you meet your organizationâ€™s standard security procedures and compliance guidelines\. 

 AFT supports account customization request tracing\. Every time you submit an account customization request, AFT generates a unique tracing token that passes through an AFT customizations AWS Step Functions state machine, which logs the token as part of its execution\. You can then use Amazon CloudWatch Logs insights queries to search timestamp ranges and retrieve the request token\. As a result, you can see payloads that accompany the token, so you can trace your account customization request throughout the entire AFT workflow\. For information about CloudWatch Logs and Step Functions, see the following: 
+  [What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide* 
+  [What is AWS Step Functions?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the *AWS Step Functions Developer Guide* 

AFT combines the capabilities of other AWS services as [Component services](aft-components.md), to build a framework, with pipelines that deploy Terraform Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\)\. AFT enables you to:
+ Submit account provisioning and update requests in a GitOps model
+ Store account metadata and audit history
+ Apply account\-level tags
+ Add customizations to all accounts, to a set of accounts, or to individual accounts
+ Enable feature options

AFT creates a separate account, called the *AFT management account*, to deploy AFT capabilities\. Before you can set up AFT, you must have an existing AWS Control Tower landing zone\. The AFT management account is not the same as the AWS Control Tower management account\.

**AFT offers flexibility**
+ **Flexibility for your platform:** AFT supports any Terraform Distribution for initial deployment and ongoing operation: Open Source, Cloud, and Enterprise\.
+ **Flexibility for your version control system:** AFT natively relies on AWS CodeCommit, but it supports alternative sources for AWS CodeStar connections\.

**AFT offers feature options**

You can enable several feature options, based on best practices:
+ Creating an organization\-level CloudTrail for logging data events
+ Deleting the AWS default VPC for accounts
+ Enrolling provisioned accounts into the AWS Enterprise Support plan

**Note**  
The AFT pipeline is not intended for use in deploying resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, that your accounts require to run your applications\. It is intended solely for automated provisioning and customizing of AWS Control Tower accounts\.
