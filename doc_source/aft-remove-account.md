# Remove an account from AFT<a name="aft-remove-account"></a>

This section walks you through the steps to remove accounts from AFT, so they are no longer deployed or updated by the pipeline\. For example, you may be closing accounts for retiring applications, isolating accounts that are compromised, or moving accounts from one organization to another\. 

Removing an account from AFT is not the same process as removing an account from AWS Control Tower or deleting it from AWS\. An account provisioned by AFT is handled in the same way as any other AWS account\. That is, the removed AFT account is not deleted, it is only removed from management by AWS Control Tower and AFT\. To delete the account completely, follow the steps in the [Billing console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)\.

**Important**  
Removing an account from the AFT pipeline is irreversible\. It can result in a loss of state\.

**Step 1: Remove account from the `git` repository that stores your account requests**

In the `git` repository where you store account requests, delete the account request for the account you intend to remove from AFT\.

**Step 2: Delete the account customizations pipeline**

In the AFT management account, delete the AWS CodePipeline for the account you intend to remove from AFT\. This pipeline has the account ID as the prefix in its name\. 

**Step 3: Delete the Terraform workspace \(For Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise customers only\)**

Delete the global customizations and account customizations workspaces for the account you intend to remove from AFT\. 

**Step 4: Delete the Terraform state from the Amazon S3 backend**

In the AFT management account, delete all relevant folders inside Amazon S3 buckets for the account you intend to remove from AFT\. In the examples that follow, replace the placeholder number `012345678901` with the AFT management account ID number\.

If you chose Terraform OSS, you will find 3 folders for each account \(related to customizations pipeline state, global and account customizations state\) in the `aft-backend-012345678901-primary-region` and `aft-backend-012345678901-secondary-region` Amazon S3 buckets\.

If you chose Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise, you will find a folder for each account \(related to customizations pipeline state\) in the `aft-backend-012345678901-primary-region` and `aft-backend-012345678901-secondary-region` S3 buckets\. 

**Step 5: Delete account metadata**

In the AFT management account, delete the account\-related metadata for the account you intend to remove from AFT\. This metadata is stored in the parameter `aft-request-metadata` in the DynamoDB table\.

**Note**  
AFT uses this metadata as input to invoke downstream stages in the AFT pipeline, such as the AFT account provisioning framework and customizations, and for global and account customizations\.
