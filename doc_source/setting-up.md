# Setting up<a name="setting-up"></a>

Before you use AWS Control Tower for the first time, complete the following tasks:

1. [Sign up for AWS](#setting-up-signup)

1. [Create an IAM User](#setting-up-iam)

These tasks create an AWS account and an IAM user with administrator privileges for the account\. For information on additional setup tasks specifically for AWS Control Tower, see [Getting started with AWS Control Tower](getting-started-with-control-tower.md)\.

## Sign up for AWS<a name="setting-up-signup"></a>

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including AWS Control Tower\. If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task\. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

Note your AWS account number, because you need it for the next task\.

## Create an IAM User<a name="setting-up-iam"></a>

Services in AWS, such as AWS Control Tower, require that your user account must provide credentials, so that the service can determine whether you have permission to utilize its resources\. AWS recommends that you don't make requests to other services from the *root user* credentials of your AWS account\. Instead, create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user and grant that user full access\. We call these full\-access users *administrators*\.

You can use the administrator credentials, instead of AWS account root user credentials of your account, to interact with AWS and perform tasks, such as create users and grant them the appropriate permissions\. For more information, see [Root Account Credentials vs\. IAM User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html) in the *AWS General Reference* and [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM Management Console\.

**To create an administrator user for yourself and add the user to an administrators group \(console\)**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the *[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)* to the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, enter **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**\. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in\. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign\-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Under **Set permissions**, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** enter **Administrators**\.

1. Choose **Filter policies**, and then select **AWS managed \-job function** to filter the table contents\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.
**Note**  
You must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the `AdministratorAccess` permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console\. To do this, follow the instructions in [step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html)\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies that restrict user permissions to specific AWS resources, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.

To sign in as this new IAM user, first sign out of the AWS Management Console\. Then use the following URL, where *your\_aws\_account\_id* is your AWS account number without the hyphens \(for example, if your AWS account number is `1234-5678-9012`, your AWS account ID is `123456789012`\)\.

```
https://your_aws_account_id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

Enter the IAM user name and password that you just created\. When you're signed in, the navigation bar displays ***your\_user\_name*****@*****your\_aws\_account\_id***\.

If you don't want the URL for your sign\-in page to contain your AWS account ID, you can create an account alias\. To do so, from the IAM dashboard, choose **Create Account Alias** and enter an alias, such as your company name\. To sign in after you create an account alias, use the following URL\.

```
https://your_account_alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

To verify the sign\-in link for IAM users for your account, open the IAM console and check under **AWS Account Alias** on the dashboard\.

### Set up MFA<a name="setup-mfa"></a>

Because of the nature of AWS Control Tower, we strongly recommend that you enable multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) for your master account\. For more information, see [Enable MFA on the AWS Account Root User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
