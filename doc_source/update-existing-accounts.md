# When to update AWS Control Tower OUs and accounts<a name="update-existing-accounts"></a>

When you perform a landing zone update, you must update your enrolled accounts to apply new controls to those accounts\.
+ You can perform an update to all accounts under an OU using the **Re\-Register** option\.
+ If you have more than one registered OU in your landing zone, re\-register all of your OUs to update all of your accounts\.
+ To update a single account, you can update from the AWS Control Tower console, or you can select the **Update provisioned product** option in AWS Service Catalog\. See [Update the account in the console](updating-account-factory-accounts.md#update-account-in-console)\.
