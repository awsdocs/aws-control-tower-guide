# Deploy Environments with AWS CloudFormation<a name="cloudformation"></a>

AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly\. It helps you leverage AWS products to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost\-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure\. AWS CloudFormation enables you to use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit \(a stack\)\. For more information, see *[AWS CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/)*\.

AWS Control Tower uses AWS CloudFormation stacksets to apply controls on accounts\. For more information about how AWS CloudFormation and AWS Control Tower work together, see [Creating AWS Control Tower resources with AWS CloudFormation](creating-resources-with-cloudformation.md)\.
