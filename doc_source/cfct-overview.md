# Customizations for AWS Control Tower \(CfCT\) overview<a name="cfct-overview"></a>

*Customizations for AWS Control Tower* \(CfCT\) helps you customize your AWS Control Tower landing zone and stay aligned with AWS best practices\. Customizations are implemented with AWS CloudFormation templates and service control policies \(SCPs\)\.

This CfCT capability is integrated with AWS Control Tower lifecycle events, so that your resource deployments remain synchronized with your landing zone\. For example, when a new account is created through account factory, all resources attached to the account are deployed automatically\. You can deploy the custom templates and policies to individual accounts and organizational units \(OUs\) within your organization\.
