# Step 2\. Configure and launch your landing zone<a name="step-two"></a>

Before you launch your AWS Control Tower landing zone, determine the most appropriate home Region\. For more information, see [ Administrative tips for landing zone setup ](tips-for-admin-setup.md)\.

**Important**  
Changing your home Region after you have deployed your AWS Control Tower landing zone requires decommissioning as well as the assistance of AWS Support\. This practice is not recommended\.

AWS Control Tower has no APIs or programmatic access for launching your landing zone\. To configure and launch your landing zone in the console, perform the following series of steps\.

**Prepare: Navigate to the AWS Control Tower console**

1. Open a web browser, and navigate to the AWS Control Tower console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/controltower](https://console.aws.amazon.com/controltower)\.

1. In the console, verify that you are working in your desired home Region for AWS Control Tower\. Then choose **Set up your landing zone**\.
