# Drift prevention and notification<a name="prevention-and-notification"></a>

You can enable certain guardrails and subscribe to certain SNS notifications that help you maintain compliance in AWS Control Tower\.

**Drift monitoring protection**

AWS Control Tower provides passive and active methods of drift monitoring protection for preventive guardrails\.
+ **Passive protection:** AWS CloudTrail monitors and logs preventive guardrail \(SCP\) drift\.
+ **Active protection:** The AWS Control Tower [drift monitoring service](drift.md#scp-invariance-scans) actively scans the preventive guardrail SCPs, on a regular basis\.

AWS Control Tower notifies you by means of SNS messaging, if drift is detected\.

**Drift prevention** 

Some guardrails prevent modification of compliance reporting mechanisms\.
+ [Disallow Changes to AWS Config Rules Set Up by AWS Control Tower](mandatory-guardrails.md#config-rule-disallow-changes) \(Mandatory, preventive guardrail\)
+ [Disallow Deletion of AWS Config Aggregation Authorizations Created by AWS Control Tower](mandatory-guardrails.md#config-aggregation-authorization-policy) \(Mandatory, preventive guardrail\)
+ [Disallow Changes to Tags Created by AWS Control Tower for AWS Config Resources](mandatory-guardrails.md#cloudwatch-disallow-config-changes) \(Mandatory, preventive guardrail\)
+ [Disallow Configuration Changes to AWS Config](mandatory-guardrails.md#config-disallow-changes) \(Mandatory, preventive guardrail\)

In contrast to preventive guardrails, detective guardrails notify you of resources that violate the associated AWS Config rule\.
