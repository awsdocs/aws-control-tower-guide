## Region deny capabilities<a name="region-deny-guardrail"></a>

**November 30, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\.\)

AWS Control Tower now provides Region deny capabilities, which assist you in limiting access to AWS services and operations for enrolled accounts in your AWS Control Tower environment\. The Region deny feature complements existing Region selection and Region deselection features in AWS Control Tower\. Together, these features help you to address compliance and regulatory concerns, while balancing the costs associated with expanding into additional Regions\.

For example, AWS customers in Germany can deny access to AWS Services in Regions outside of the Frankfurt Region\. You can select restricted Regions during the AWS Control Tower set up process, or in the **Landing zone settings** page\. The Region deny feature is available when you update your AWS Control Tower landing zone version\. Select AWS services are exempt from Region deny capabilities\. To learn more, see [Configure the Region deny guardrail](region-deny.md)\.

## Data residency features<a name="data-residency-feature"></a>

**November 30, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower now offers purpose\-built guardrails to help ensure that any customer data you upload to AWS services is located only in the AWS Regions that you specify\. You can select the AWS Region or Regions in which your customer data is stored and processed\. For a full list of AWS Regions where AWS Control Tower is available, see the [AWS Region Table](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)\.

For granular control, you can apply additional guardrails, such as **Disallow Amazon Virtual Private Network \(VPN\) connections**, or **Disallow internet access for an Amazon VPC instance**\. You can view the compliance status of the guardrails in the AWS Control Tower console\. For a full list of available guardrails, see [Guardrail reference](guardrails-reference.md)\. 

## AWS Control Tower introduces Terraform account provisioning and customization<a name="aft-available"></a>

**November 29, 2021**

\(Optional update for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

You can now employ Terraform to provision and update customized accounts through AWS Control Tower, with *AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform \(AFT\)*\.

AFT provides a single Terraform infrastructure as code \(IaC\) pipeline, which provisions accounts managed by AWS Control Tower\. Customizations during provisioning help to meet your business and security policies, before you give the accounts to end\-users\.

The AFT automated account creation pipeline monitors until account provisioning is complete, and then it continues, triggering additional Terraform modules that enhance the account with any necessary customizations\. As an additional part of the customization process, you can configure the pipeline to install your own custom Terraform modules, and you can choose to add any of the AFT Feature Options, which are provided by AWS for common customizations\.

Get started with AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform by following the steps provided in the * AWS Control Tower User Guide*, [Deploy AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform \(AFT\)](aft-getting-started.md) , and by downloading AFT for your Terraform instance\. AFT supports Terraform Cloud, Terraform Enterprise, and Terraform Open Source distributions\.

## New lifecycle event available<a name="precheck-organizational-unit-event"></a>

**November 18, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

The `PrecheckOrganizationalUnit` event logs whether any resources block the **Extend governance** task from success, including resources in nested OUs\. For more information, see [`PrecheckOrganizationalUnit`](lifecycle-events.md#precheck-organizational-unit)\.

## AWS Control Tower enables nested OUs<a name="nested-ou"></a>

**November 16, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower now enables you to include nested OUs as part of your landing zone\.

AWS Control Tower provides support for nested organizational units \(OUs\), allowing you to organize accounts into multiple hierarchy levels, and to enforce preventive guardrails hierarchically\. You can register OUs containing nested OUs, create and register OUs under parent OUs, and enable guardrails on any registered OU, regardless of depth\. To support this functionality, the console shows the number of governed accounts and OUs\.

With nested OUs, you can align your AWS Control Tower OUs to the AWS multi\-account strategy, and you can reduce the time required to enable guardrails on multiple OUs, by enforcing guardrails at the parent OU level\.

**Key considerations**

1. You can register existing, multi\-level OUs with AWS Control Tower one OU at a time, starting with the top\-level OU and then proceeding down the tree\. For more information, see [Expand from flat OU structure to nested OU structure](nested-ous.md#flat-to-nested)\.

1. Accounts directly under a registered OU are enrolled automatically\. Accounts further down the tree can be enrolled by registering their immediate parent OU\.

1. Preventive guardrails \(SCPs\) are inherited down the hierarchy automatically; SCPs applied to the parent are inherited by all nested OUs\. 

1. Detective guardrails \(AWS Config rules\) are NOT inherited automatically\.

1. Compliance with detective guardrails is reported by each OU\.

1. SCP drift on an OU affects all accounts and OUs under it\.

1. You cannot create new nested OUs under the Security OU \(Core OU\)\.

## Detective guardrail concurrency<a name="detective-guardrail-concurrency"></a>

**November 5, 2021**

\(Optional update for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower detective guardrails now support concurrent operations for detective guardrails, improving the ease of use and performance\. You can enable multiple detective guardrails without waiting for individual guardrail operations to complete\.

**Supported functionality:**
+ Enable different detective guardrails on the same OU \(for example, **Detect Whether MFA for the Root User is Enabled** and **Detect Whether Public Write Access to Amazon S3 Buckets is Allowed**\)\.
+ Enable different detective guardrails on different OUs, concurrently\. 
+ Guardrail error messaging has been improved to give additional guidance for supported guardrail concurrency operations\. 

**Not supported:**
+ Enabling the same detective guardrail on multiple OUs concurrently is not supported\.
+ *Preventive* guardrail concurrency is not supported\.

You can experience the detective guardrail concurrency improvements in all versions of AWS Control Tower\. It is recommended that customers not currently on version 2\.7 perform a landing zone update to take advantage of other features, such as Region selection and deselection, which are available in the latest version\.

## Two new Regions available<a name="paris-and-sao-paulo"></a>

**July 29, 2021**

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower is now available in two additional AWS Regions: South America \(Sao Paulo\), and Europe \(Paris\)\. This update expands AWS Control Tower availability to 15 AWS Regions\. 

If you are new to AWS Control Tower, you can launch it right away in any of the supported Regions\. During the launch, you can select the Regions in which you want AWS Control Tower to build and govern your multi\-account environment\.

If you already have an AWS Control Tower environment and you want to extend or remove AWS Control Tower governance features in one or more supported Regions, go to the **Landing Zone Settings** page in your AWS Control Tower dashboard, then select the Regions\. After updating your landing zone, you must then [update all accounts that are governed by AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/configuration-updates.html#deploying-to-new-region)\.

## Region deselection<a name="region-deselect"></a>

**July 29, 2021**

\(Optional update for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower Region deselection enhances your ability to manage the geographical footprint of your AWS Control Tower resources\. You can deselect Regions you would no longer like AWS Control Tower to govern\. This feature provides you with the capability to address compliance and regulatory concerns while balancing the costs associated with expanding into additional Regions\.

Region deselection is available when you update your AWS Control Tower landing zone version\. 

When you use Account Factory to create a new account or enroll a pre\-existing member account, or when you select **Extend Governance** to enroll accounts in a pre\-existing organizational unit, AWS Control Tower deploys its governance capabilities—which include centralized logging, monitoring, and guardrails— in your chosen Regions in the accounts\. Choosing to deselect a Region and remove AWS Control Tower governance from that Region removes that governance functionality, but it does not inhibit your users’ ability to deploy AWS resources or workloads into those Regions\. 

## AWS Control Tower works with AWS Key Management Systems<a name="kms-keys"></a>

**July 28, 2021**

\(Optional update for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower provides you the option to use an AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) key\. A key is provided and managed by you, to secure the services that AWS Control Tower deploys, including AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and the associated AWS S3 data\. AWS KMS encryption is an enhanced level of encryption over the SSE\-S3 encryption that AWS Control Tower uses by default\.

The integration of AWS KMS support into AWS Control Tower aligns with the **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices**, which recommend an added layer of security for your sensitive log files\. You should use AWS KMS–managed keys \(SSE\-KMS\) for encryption at rest\. AWS KMS encryption support is available when you set up a new landing zone or when you update your existing AWS Control Tower landing zone\.

To configure this functionality, you can select **KMS Key Configuration** during your initial landing zone setup\. You can choose an existing KMS key, or you can select a button that directs you to the AWS KMS console to create a new one\. You also have the flexibility to change from default encryption to SSE\-KMS, or to a different SSE\-KMS key\.

For an existing AWS Control Tower landing zone, you can perform an update to start using AWS KMS keys\. 

## Guardrails renamed, functionality unchanged<a name="guardrail-renaming"></a>

**July 26, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower is revising certain guardrails names and descriptions to better reflect the policy intentions of the guardrail\. The revised names and descriptions help you understand more intuitively the ways in which guardrails enhance control of your accounts\. For example, we changed part of the names of detective guardrails from “Disallow” to “Detect” because the detective guardrail itself does not stop a specific action, it only detects policy violations and provides alerts through the dashboard\.

Guardrail functionality, guidance, and implementation remain unchanged\. Only the guardrail names and descriptions have been revised\.

## AWS Control Tower scans SCPs daily to check for drift<a name="daily-scp-scans"></a>

**May 11, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower now performs daily automated scans of your managed SCPs to verify that the corresponding guardrails are applied correctly and that they have not drifted\. If a scan discovers drift, you'll receive a notification\. AWS Control Tower sends only one notification per drift issue, so if your landing zone already is in a state of drift, you wo n't receive additional notifications unless a new drift item is found\.

## Customized names for OUs and accounts<a name="rename-core-ous-and-accounts"></a>

**April 16, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower now allows you to customize your landing zone naming\. You can retain the names that AWS Control Tower recommends for the organizational units \(OUs\) and core accounts, or you can modify these names during the initial landing zone set up process\.

The default names that AWS Control Tower provides for the OUs and core accounts match the AWS multi\-account best practices guidance\. However, if your company has specific naming policies, or if you already have an existing OU or account with the same recommended name, the new OU and account naming functionality gives you the flexibility to address those constraints\.

Separately from that workflow change during setup, the OU formerly known as the Core OU is now called the Security OU, and the OU formerly known as the Custom OU is now called the Sandbox OU\. We made this change to improve our alignment with overall AWS best practices guidance for naming\.

New customers will see these new OU names\. Existing customers will continue to see the original names of these OUs\. You may encounter some inconsistencies in OU naming while we are updating our documentation to the new names\.

To get started with AWS Control Tower from the AWS Management Console, go to the AWS Control Tower console, and select **Set up landing zone** in the top right\. For additional information, you can read about planning your AWS Control Tower landing zone\.

## AWS Control Tower landing zone version 2\.7<a name="version-2.7"></a>

**April 8, 2021**

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone to version 2\.7\. For information, see [Update Your Landing Zone](configuration-updates.md#update-controltower)\)

With AWS Control Tower version 2\.7, AWS Control Tower introduces four new mandatory preventative Log Archive guardrails that implement policy solely on AWS Control Tower resources\. We have adjusted the guidance on four existing Log Archive guardrails from mandatory to elective, because they set policy for resources outside of AWS Control Tower\. This guardrail change and expansion provides the ability to separate Log Archive governance for resources within AWS Control Tower from governance of resources outside of AWS Control Tower\.

The four changed guardrails can be used in conjunction with the new mandatory guardrails to provide governance to a broader set of AWS Log Archives\. Existing AWS Control Tower environments will keep these four changed guardrails enabled automatically, for environment consistency; however, these elective guardrails now can be disabled\. New AWS Control Tower environments must enable all elective guardrails\. **Existing environments must disable the formerly mandatory guardrails before adding encryption to S3 buckets that are not deployed by AWS Control Tower\.**

**New mandatory guardrails:**
+ Disallow Changes to Encryption Configuration for AWS Control Tower Created S3 Buckets in Log Archive 
+ Disallow Changes to Logging Configuration for AWS Control Tower Created S3 Buckets in Log Archive
+ Disallow Changes to Bucket Policy for AWS Control Tower Created S3 Buckets in Log Archive 
+ Disallow Changes to Lifecycle Configuration for AWS Control Tower Created S3 Buckets in Log Archive

**Guidance changed from Mandatory to Elective:**
+ Disallow Changes to Encryption Configuration for all Amazon S3 Buckets \[Previously: Enable Encryption at Rest for Log Archive\]
+ Disallow Changes to Logging Configuration for all Amazon S3 Buckets \[Previously: Enable Access Logging for Log Archive\]
+ Disallow Changes to Bucket Policy for all Amazon S3 Buckets \[Previously: Disallow Policy Changes to Log Archive\]
+ Disallow Changes to Lifecycle Configuration for all Amazon S3 Buckets \[Previously: Set a Retention Policy for Log Archive\]

AWS Control Tower version 2\.7 includes changes to the AWS Control Tower landing zone blueprint that can cause incompatibility with previous versions after you upgrade to 2\.7\. 
+ In particular, AWS Control Tower version 2\.7 enables `BlockPublicAccess` automatically on S3 buckets deployed by AWS Control Tower\. You can turn this default off if your workload requires access across accounts\. For more information about what happens with `BlockPublicaccess` enabled, see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html)\.
+ AWS Control Tower version 2\.7 includes a requirement for HTTPS\. All requests sent to S3 buckets deployed by AWS Control Tower must use secure socket layer \(SSL\)\. Only HTTPS requests are allowed to pass\. If you use HTTP \(without SSL\) as an endpoint to send the requests, this change gives you an access denied error, which can potentially break your workflow\. **This change cannot be reverted after the 2\.7 update to your landing zone\.**

  *We recommend that you change your requests to use TLS instead of HTTP\.*

## Three new AWS Regions available<a name="three-new-regions"></a>

**April 8, 2021**

\(Update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower is available in three additional AWS Regions: Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) Region, Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) Region, and Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) Region\. A landing zone update to version 2\.7 is required for expanding governance into these Regions\.

 Your landing zone is not expanded automatically into these Regions when you perform the update to version 2\.7, you must view and select them in the Regions table for inclusion\.

## Govern selected Regions only<a name="region-select"></a>

**February 19, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower Region selection provides better ability to manage the geographical footprint of your AWS Control Tower resources\. To expand the number of Regions in which you host AWS resources or workloads – for compliance, regulatory, cost, or other reasons – you can now select the additional Regions to govern\. 

Region selection is available when you set up a new landing zone or update your AWS Control Tower landing zone version\. When you use Account Factory to create a new account or enroll a pre\-existing member account, or when you use **Extend Governance** to enroll accounts in a pre\-existing organizational unit, AWS Control Tower deploys its governance capabilities of centralized logging, monitoring, and guardrails in your chosen Regions in the accounts\. For more information about selecting Regions, see [Configure your AWS Control Tower Regions](region-how.md#deploying-to-new-region)\.

## AWS Control Tower now extends governance to existing OUs in your AWS organizations<a name="extended-governance"></a>

**January 28, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

Extend governance to existing organizational units \(OUs\) \(those not in AWS Control Tower\) from within the AWS Control Tower console\. With this feature, you can bring top\-level OUs and included accounts under AWS Control Tower governance\. For information about extending governance to an entire OU, see [Register an existing organizational unit with AWS Control Tower](importing-existing.md)\.

When you register an OU, AWS Control Tower performs a series of checks to ensure successful extension of governance and enrollment of accounts within the OU\. For more information about common issues associated with the initial registration of an OU, see [Common causes of failure during registration or re\-registration](importing-existing.md#common-eg-failures)\.

You can also visit the AWS Control Tower [product webpage](http://aws.amazon.com/controltower/) or visit YouTube to watch this video about [getting started with AWS Control Tower for AWS Organizations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwRy0t8nfgM)\.

## AWS Control Tower provides bulk account updates<a name="bulk-update"></a>

**January 28, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

With the bulk update feature, you can now update all accounts in a registered AWS Organizations organizational unit \(OU\) containing up to 300 accounts, with a single click, from the AWS Control Tower dashboard\. This is particularly useful in cases where you update your AWS Control Tower landing zone and must also update your enrolled accounts to align them to the current landing zone version\. 

This feature also helps you keep your accounts up to date when you update your AWS Control Tower landing zone to expand to new regions, or when you want to re\-register an OU to ensure that all accounts in that OU have the latest guardrails applied\. Bulk account update eliminates the need to update one account at a time or use an external script to perform the update on multiple accounts\.

For information about updating a landing zone, see [Update Your Landing Zone](configuration-updates.md#update-controltower)\.

For information about registering or re\-registering an OU, see [Register an existing organizational unit with AWS Control Tower](importing-existing.md)\.
