# Manage Permissions for Entities with IAM<a name="iam"></a>

AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services\. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access\.

When you set up your landing zone, a number of groups are created for AWS Single Sign\-On\. These groups have permission sets that are pre\-defined permissions policies from IAM\. Your end users can also use IAM to define the scope of permissions for IAM users and other entities within member accounts\.
